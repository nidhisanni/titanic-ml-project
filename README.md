# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

**Author:** Nidhi Sanni  
**Project Type:** Supervised Classification (Binary)  
**Dataset:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)


## Objective
To predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. This project covers data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest), and evaluation.


##  Project Workflow
-  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
-  Handling Missing Values  
-  Feature Engineering (e.g., `Title`, `FamilySize`)  
-  Label Encoding of Categorical Variables  
-  Model Training (Random Forest)  
- Accuracy Achieved: ~83%


##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn


##  Key Learnings
- Importance of feature engineering in boosting model accuracy
- Encoding techniques for categorical data
- Visualizing feature importance in tree-based models
